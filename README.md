# For-Loop Chess Board

This repository outlines the use of for loops and nested for loops starting with vanilla JavaScript and then extends the logic to examples in the [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) and [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) JavaScript Libraries. This is based on the [Chess Board exercise](Chess Board exercise) part of Chapter 2 of the book [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/).
